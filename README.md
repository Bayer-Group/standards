# MonsantoCo Standards

We appreciate your interest in our open source projects.  This
repository contains various standards and guidelines for interacting
with our open source projects.  Our intention is to keep our
standards, and our code, simple and flexible.

## Repositories

All open source repositories should have a README that provides useful
documentation for that project and a MAINTAINERS file listing the
contributors to the repository.

Guidelines for contributing to our open source projects, including
this Standards repository, can be found in
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you.
